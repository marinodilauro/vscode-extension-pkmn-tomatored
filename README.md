## 🎯 How It Works

1. Start a Pomodoro session using the command `Start Pokémon TomatoRed Timer`
2. Focus on your work for 25 minutes
3. During breaks:
   - A wild Pokémon will appear in the sidebar view (click the <img src="./src/resources/pokeball_color.svg" alt="Pokéball icon" width="16" height="16"> Pokéball icon in the Activity Bar to open it)
   - Try to catch it before the break ends by clicking on the Pokéball on top of the sidebar view
